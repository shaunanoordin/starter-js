# Starter JS

Starter template for JS projects.

## Development

* This is a web app built on HTML5, JavaScript and CSS.
* It uses Babel to transpile 'modern' ES6 code into 'current' (2016) Javascript code.
* It also uses Stylus to make writing CSS easier.
* Developing the web app requires Node.js installed on your machine and a handy command line interface. (Bash, cmd.exe, etc)
* However, the _compiled_ web app itself can be run simply by opening the `index.html` in a web browser. (Chrome, Firefox, etc)

Starting the project:

1. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`
2. Run `npm start` to start the server.
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` on your browser to view the app.
